Chicago has many historic places to visit. Keith found the Chicago Water Tower impressive as it is one of the few
remaining landmarks to have survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Keith also took a walk through Jackson Park,
a great outdoor space that hosted the World’s Fair of 1892. The park is great for a leisurely stroll, and it still
features some of the original architecture and replicas of monuments that were featured in the World’s Fair.
